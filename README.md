Make a copy of the project to your machine.
In any chosen terminal, open the project and navigate to the location of data.json. This should be in the general project folder.
Run this command: json-server --watch data.json --port 5000. If port 5000 is not available, PostContext and UserContext files should be changed (port number 5000 should be changed to one available on your machine). Eg. port 3000 is available, so 'http://localhost:5000' should be changed to http://localhost:3000 Other occurences should be changed too.
